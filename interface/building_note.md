# Building execute file

Run this command to create a new `exe` file from the main script:

```sh
pyinstaller main.py
```

After the building process done, we can get the built `exe` file in the `./dist` path.

**Note:**

The pyinstaller tool is installed using `pip` with the `requirements.txt` file.
